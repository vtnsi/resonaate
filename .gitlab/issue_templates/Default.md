# Welcome

Thanks for creating an issue! We appreciate your contribution to the RESONAATE project.

Click the "Preview" tab to see this **formatted** properly.
Review the [GitLab Quick Actions][quick actions] and [GitLab Flavored Markdown][gfm] pages if you need help with formatting.
Review the [Contributing Guidelines][contributing] for details on common developer tasks.

Select an issue template using the <kbd>Description</kbd> dropdown:

- `Bug`: for reporting undesired/breaking behavior
- `Default`: only for providing guidance; it shouldn't be used to fill out an issue
- `Feature`: for requesting additions, upgrades, or changes

After selecting the appropriate template, **please fill it out completely**, and include as much detail as possible because it will help others understand.

**NOTE:**

> Only assign a `Bug` or `Feature` issue to yourself if you plan to begin work soon. `Slides` issues should be immediately assigned to the designated primary presenter/creator.
