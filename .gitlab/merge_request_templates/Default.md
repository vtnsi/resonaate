# Welcome

Thanks for creating a merge request (MR)! We appreciate your contribution to the RESONAATE project.

Click the "Preview" tab to see this **formatted** properly.
Review the [GitLab Quick Actions][quick actions] and [GitLab Flavored Markdown][gfm] pages if you need help with formatting.
Review the [Contributing Guidelines][contributing] for details on common developer tasks.

We *typically* ask that MRs are created only once they are ~80% complete. This keeps the "noise" down by preventing MRs that require many refactors & fixes.

Select an MR template using the <kbd>Description</kbd> dropdown:

- `Bug`: for fixing reported ~"Type: BUG" issues
- `Default`: only for providing guidance; it shouldn't be used to fill out the MR
- `Feature`: for implementing requested ~"Type: ENH", ~"Type: REF", ~"Type: INT", & ~"Type: DEV" issues
- `Release`: for officially releasing the next `resonaate` version

After selecting the appropriate template, **please fill it out completely**, and include as much detail as possible because it will help others understand.

**NOTE:**

> Assign the MR to whoever authored the work, but do not initially assign a reviewer. Only once the MR is close to finished should you assign a reviewer. If you want eyes on it earlier, ask another contributor directly!
