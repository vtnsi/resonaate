# Release History

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Versioning

This project is currently under *rapid development*, and so our versioning does not necessarily follow Semantic Versioning.
We use a Major, Minor, Patch versioning scheme, but only patch version updates are not supposed to break backwards compatibility.
Minor version updates can (and likely will) break some API assumptions, as they add new features or change the usage of current features.
Major version updates are reserved for changes such as complete redesigns of key packages or changes that require a complete reinstallation.

- Minor improvements to entry-point script in `resonaate/__main__.py`
- `launch.json` debugging configurations with and without db saving
- `Task` objects are now `Jobs` to prevent a naming conflict with sensor tasking
- `TaskingData` is now named `Task`, see above
- Earth orientation parameters are no longer kept in the databases, but are loaded from disk and cached
- JSON/YAML config to fit new `ScenarioConfig` class

### Removed

- `EarthOrientationParams` & `NutationParams` are no longer a valid DB table, can be cached
- Options `PhysicsModelDataPath` and `EphemerisPreLoaded` for behavioral config file
- `scripts` directory, and put in a separate project
- Large fraction of the preloaded truth data for unit tests
- `insertData()`, `deleteData()`, & `bulkSave()` from `ImporterDatabase` because it is **read-only**
- `ImporterDatabase` initialization from `ScenarioBuilder` constructor
- `events` module

### Fixed

- Properly call `WorkerManager.stopWorkers()` at the end of simulation
- North-facing sensors' azimuth mask was not handled properly causing `isVisible()` to always return false ([#78][old - #78])
- `TaskingEngine.observations` weren't reset unless `getCurrentObservations()` was called ([#79][old - #79] & [!39][old - !39])
- Config values of `0` were not handled, and so those field were set to the default value ([#76][old - #76] & [!37][old - !37])
- Config `"random_seed": null` was not handled. Changed valid option to `"os"` ([#77][old - #77] & [!38][old - !38])
- No `output` directory caused RESONAATE to crash ([#54][old - #54])
- `TaskingData` were published to DB with `julian_date_start` rather than `julian_date_epoch`
- DB table equality operator
- `JulianDate` subtraction & comparison operators

## [1.1.1][v1.1.1] - 2021-03-25

Fix environment variable reading security issue and change Git workflow docs.

### Changed

- Documentation on release process and Git workflow

### Security

- Feature to read environment variable pointing to config file (see [#62][old - #62])

## [1.1.0][v1.1.0] - 2021-03-24

Update that includes multiple sensor networks.

### Added

- `EngineConfig` object
- Large & medium target config sets
- Designate separate sensor networks & target sets for different tasking engines
- `asyncUpdateEstimate()` for separately applying observations _a posteriori_
- `AllVisibleDecision` class for high-volume sensors like large phased array radars

### Changed

- Split `EstimateAgent` update and `executeTasking()` parallelization into separate files
- `sensor_list` passed to `asyncCalculateReward()` for down-selecting this engine's sensors
- `target_num` passed to `asyncExecuteTasking()` for down-selecting this engine's targets
- moved parallelization of executing tasks and applying observations to `Scenario`

### Removed

- `networks` sub-package
- debugging logic in `metrics` sub-package

## [1.0.1][v1.0.1] - 2021-01-21

Added new `Scenario` factor methods. Also updated documentation for new formats.

### Added

- `Scenario.parseConfigFile()` for automatically parsing main the scenario configuration file
- `Scenario.fromConfigFile()` for creating `Scenario` from a given file path

### Changed

- `Scenario.fromConfig()` factory method accepts only proper JSON objects/dictionaries
- `scenario` unit tests fixed for new factory methods

### Fixed

- Outdated scenario configuration documentation in `initialization.md`

## [1.0.0][v1.0.0] - 2021-01-14

Large update to a "Version 1.0" of the RESONAATE tool. This is to make a hard stop where main architectural changes and major features were completed and introduced bugs were fixed.

### Added

- CI/CD integration for automated testing/linting
- Support for YAML scenario configuration files
- Debug mode for runs, including a CLI argument. Allows blocking behavior in the workers
- Warning and logging for de-orbiting satellites at 0 km & 100 km altitude, resp.
- `sensor_utils.py` module for common sensor-related calculations
- `scenario` sub-package for holding modules directly related to the `Scenario` class
- Integration method attribute in scenario configuration
- `Reward` type combining cost-constrained & staleness metric
- Redis password is retrievable via an environment variable `REDIS_PASSWORD`, or `None`

### Changed

- Updated `requirements.txt`, and split out development tool requirements
- Moved factory methods into their respective class definitions
- `BehavioralConfig` is settable. It requires `getConfig()` to be called
- `DataInterface` now uses a context manager for the DB session object
- Filter debugging logic is now its own module
- `Clock` class now associated with `scenario` sub-package
- Streamlined the `Scenario` factory pattern & `Sensor` class
- `Decision` callable interface no longer accepts `visibility_matrix` as an argument

### Removed

- `TaskingEngine` being an attribute of `Network` objects
- Duplicate `sensors.observation.Observation` class because it can be handled by the DB table class
- `observation_factory.py` module

### Fixed

- `safeArcCos()` now properly checks for non-rounding cases when called
- Small corner-case sign errors in reference frame rotations
- Incorrect lighting conditions

## 0.9.0 - 2020-10-20

Mostly config/refactoring updates since the initial port.

### Added

- Empty db files for testing

### Changed

- `SpecialPerturbations` and `TwoBody` propagate multiple ODE at once, reflected in `UKF` as well
- Renamed source code folder to `resonaate`.

### Fixed

- `KLDivergence` hotfix
- `UKF` bugs

## 0.0.0 - 2020-05-08

Initial version ported to a new repository.

### Added

- Multiple reward & decision `callable` classes for tasking
- `TimeSinceObservation` metric for considering observation frequency
- `KLDivergence` metric for comparing information gains
- Deduplicate of imported observations
- Database interface for outputting data, rather than writing to JSON files
- New DB table `Task` for storing tasking information

### Changed

- Moved `metrics`, `rewards`, `core`, `decisions` packages into a combined `tasking` sub-package
- `tasking` package is now modular, and can be customized from a JSON configuration file
- `async_functions.py` logic for new tasking API
- JSON config file format, added many more options for propagation, noise, target set, sensor set, time span, etc.
- Module/package structure and names for better organization
- Refactored parallel processing logic into its own sub-package `parallel`
- Renamed `Config` to `BehavioralConfig` to separate from `ScenarioConfig`
- `Agent` API by creating `TargetAgent`, `SensingAgent`, and `EstimateAgent` classes

### Removed

- Old JSON config file format no longer works
- `central_core_30.py` and `central_core_40.py` modules
- `user_interface.py` module
- `copyable.py` module

### Fixed

- Streamlined visibility calculations
