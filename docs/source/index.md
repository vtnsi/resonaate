# RESONAATE Documentation

Welcome to the RESONAATE (Responsive Space Observation Analysis & Autonomous Tasking Engine) documentation!

With the expected resident space object (RSO) population growth and improvements of satellite propulsion capabilities, it has become increasingly apparent that maintaining space domain awareness (SDA) in future decades will require using human-on-the-loop autonomy as opposed to the current human-in-the-loop methods.

RESONAATE provides a stable, configurable API for advance algorithms related to SDA research, especially big-data oriented problems.
The main library API is written in Python to make it easy to use, distribute, extend, and to reduce the amount of programming knowledge required to perform SDA research.

Alongside the library, a command line interface (CLI) tool ({command}`resonaate`) is provided to easily start & configure large-scale SDA simulations.
This interface combines many settings and algorithm to perform truth simulation of sensor and target dynamics, incorporating dynamic state estimation of targets, and autonomously tasking sensors to track the estimated targets.
More specific details on how the CLI works can be seen in {mod}`.cli` and details on the JSON configuration format can be seen in {ref}`ref-cfg-top`.

Here are some of the features that RESONAATE has to offer:

- {class}`.EstimateAgent`, {class}`.SensingAgent`, and {class}`.TargetAgent` classes for agent-based simulation
- High-fidelity, configurable orbit propagation using Cowell's method
- {class}`.UnscentedKalmanFilter` for tracking RSOs
- Multiple {class}`.Sensor` types to take measurements of targets
- Corresponding database model for long-term-storage of simulated data
- Configurable and extendible {class}`.ScenarioConfig` class for changing simulation options
- Parallelization across multiple cores and machines
- Dynamic event system that can perform various spacecraft maneuvers and more

An overview of the motivation, design, framework, and terminology is provided below in {ref}`main-index-abstract`.
The sidebar on the left has more pages organized into targeted sets of information.
See {ref}`main-index-site` for a description of these sections.

The U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN)
```

The RESONAATE simulation creates a decision making engine that can create a tasking strategy for a diversely populated space object surveillance and identification (SOSI) network.
The figure on the right ({numref}`index-main-fig-ssn`) shows a visual representation of the United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN).
RESONAATE often uses a version of this model, but also provides the flexibility to construct an arbitrary SSN with different sensors.
The RESONAATE simulation tracks multiple maneuvering and non-maneuvering RSO using the given SSN, and attempts to do so in a responsive, autonomous, and optimal way.

RESONAATE models the RSO tracking (or sensor management) problem as a sub-optimal partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which defines actions as which RSO to task various ground and space-based sensors to track at a given time.
A representation of the POMDP model is shown below ({numref}`index-main-fig-pomdp`).
The POMDP algorithm implements multiple types of metrics to measure the value of tasking opportunities.
Examples of these include sensor usage metrics, information theoretic metrics, stability metrics, and behavioral metrics.
The successful measurements from the tasked sensors are combined using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to maintain viable orbit estimates for all targets.
This process is repeated over sequential time steps for the entire simulation length.
The RESONAATE simulation stores both truth and estimated state information into a SQL database which allows for comparisons of various algorithms across different portions of the RSO tracking problem (e.g. tasking, estimation, or fusion) by directly measuring the global performance.
It is also easy to perform Monte Carlo studies to determine algorithm sensitivity, or parametric studies to determine trade offs for tunable algorithm parameters.

## Site Contents

{ref}`main-index-started` goes over basic information on how to install, setup, and use the RESONAATE tool and library.
This section is the main jumping off point for new users or anyone trying to get a general understanding of the RESONAATE use cases.

{ref}`main-index-ref` details specific information on how RESONAATE works such as the JSON config format and the library API documentation.
This section targets users and developers alike for quickly and efficiently finding out more information on how to use various features of RESONAATE.

{ref}`main-index-tech` is meant for in-depth description of the mathematics, physics, and software engineering that RESONAATE is built upon.
The idea is that the bulk of equations, references, derivations, and assumptions can be kept here, so that code documentation strings can remain manageable.

{ref}`main-index-dev` provides detailed descriptions about key processes, RESONAATE distribution & integration, as well as design philosophies.
The material here is meant specifically for RESONAATE software developers to reference for how to better work with the RESONAATE team.

{ref}`main-index-meta` holds extra details about the RESONAATE software package that while being important, are not directly applicable to understanding RESONAATE itself.
These pages serve as a way to document software history, references, licensing, and other "metadata" about the tool/library.
