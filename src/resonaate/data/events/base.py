    :attr:`.Agent.simulation_id` of the :class:`~.agent_base.Agent` instance that needs to handle it.

    Note:
        Typically, events are handled when the "scope instance" that they correlate to calls the
        :meth:`.events.handleRelevantEvents()` function. However, in the case of the "AGENT_PROPAGATION" scope, events
        need to be handled differently. There are two primary reasons for this:

        - :class:`~.agent_base.Agent`s handle their propagation in parallel. The :meth:`.events.handleRelevantEvents()`
          function requires database access and while the default database implementation of SQLite can
          *technically* handle concurrent reads, it's not advised.
        - There are typically **many** :class:`~.agent_base.Agent`s in a :class:`.Scenario`, so having each of
          them query the database for their individual events is wildly inefficient.

        Rather than each :class:`~.agent_base.Agent` being responsible for finding and handling their own events, events
        are instead collected in :meth:`.AgentPropagationJobHandler.generateJobs()` and queued for each
        :class:`~.agent_base.Agent`.
